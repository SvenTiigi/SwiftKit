# KITPROJECT

<p align="center">
ℹ️ Short description of KITPROJECT
</p>

## Features

- [x] ℹ️ Add KITPROJECT features

## Example

The example application is the best way to see `KITPROJECT` in action. Simply open the `KITPROJECT.xcodeproj` and run the `Example` scheme.

## Installation

### CocoaPods

KITPROJECT is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). To install
it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

```bash
pod 'KITPROJECT'
```

### Carthage

[Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) is a decentralized dependency manager that builds your dependencies and provides you with binary frameworks.

To integrate KITPROJECT into your Xcode project using Carthage, specify it in your `Cartfile`:

```ogdl
github "KITGITHUBHANDLE/KITPROJECT"
```

Run `carthage update` to build the framework and drag the built `KITPROJECT.framework` into your Xcode project. 

On your application targets’ “Build Phases” settings tab, click the “+” icon and choose “New Run Script Phase” and add the Framework path as mentioned in [Carthage Getting started Step 4, 5 and 6](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage/blob/master/README.md#if-youre-building-for-ios-tvos-or-watchos)

### Swift Package Manager

To integrate using Apple's [Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/), add the following as a dependency to your `Package.swift`:

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "KITURL.git", from: "1.0.0")
]
```

Alternatively navigate to your Xcode project, select `Swift Packages` and click the `+` icon to search for `KITPROJECT`.

### Manually

If you prefer not to use any of the aforementioned dependency managers, you can integrate KITPROJECT into your project manually. Simply drag the `Sources` Folder into your Xcode project.
